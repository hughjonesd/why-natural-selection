	Abstract = {The timing of reproductive behaviour {\textendash} age at first sexual intercourse (AFS) and age at first birth (AFB) {\textendash} has implications for reproductive health, adolescent development and evolutionary fitness. In the largest genome-wide association study to date (AFS, N=387,338; AFB, N=542,901), we identify 370 independent signals, 11 which are sex-specific, with a 5-6\% polygenic score prediction. Heritability shifted from 10\% for those born in 1940 to 23\% for the 1965 birth cohort. Using Genomic SEM, we show that signals are largely driven by the genetics of reproductive biology and externalizing behaviour. This is supported by extensive biological follow-up that isolates key genes related to follicle stimulating hormone (FSHB), implantation (ESR1), infertility (endometriosis, spontaneous abortion) and spermatid differentiation, morphogenesis and binding (KLF17, ZPBP). Later AFB is protective against later-life disease (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular) and associated with longevity. Those from higher childhood socioeconomic circumstances and polygenic scores in the highest deciles (90\%+) experience markedly later reproductive onset. Results are relevant for interventions in teenage sexual, reproductive and mental health, deepen our understanding of the drivers of later-life health and longevity, and fuel infertility and functional follow-up experiments.Competing Interest StatementThe main authors declare no competing interests.

	Abstract = {{The UK Biobank cohort is a population-based cohort of 500,000 participants recruited in the United Kingdom (UK) between 2006 and 2010. Approximately 9.2 million individuals aged 40{\^a}€``69 years who lived within 25 miles (40 km) of one of 22 assessment centers in England, Wales, and Scotland were invited to enter the cohort, and 5.5\\% participated in the baseline assessment. The representativeness of the UK Biobank cohort was investigated by comparing demographic characteristics between nonresponders and responders. Sociodemographic, physical, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics of the cohort were compared with nationally representative data sources. UK Biobank participants were more likely to be older, to be female, and to live in less socioeconomically deprived areas than nonparticipants. Compared with the general population, participants were less likely to be obese, to smoke, and to drink alcohol on a daily basis and had fewer self-reported health conditions. At age 70{\^a}€``74 years, rates of all-cause mortality and total cancer incidence were 46.2\\% and 11.8\\% lower, respectively, in men and 55.5\\% and 18.1\\% lower, respectively, in women than in the general population of the same age. UK Biobank is not representative of the sampling population; there is evidence of a {\^a}€{\oe}healthy volunteer{\^a}€ selection bias. Nonetheless, valid assessment of exposure-disease relationships may be widely generalizable and does not require participants to be representative of the population at large.}},

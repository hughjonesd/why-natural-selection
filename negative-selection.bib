	abstract = {Estimates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) represent a combination of the effect of inherited genetic variation (direct effects), demography (population stratification, assortative mating) and genetic nurture from relatives (indirect genetic effects). GWAS using family-based designs can control for demography and indirect genetic effects, but large-scale family datasets have been lacking. We combined data on 159,701 siblings from 17 cohorts to generate population (between-family) and within-sibship (within-family) estimates of genome-wide genetic associations for 25 phenotypes. We demonstrate that existing GWAS associations for height, educational attainment, smoking, depressive symptoms, age at first birth and cognitive ability overestimate direct effects. We show that estimates of SNP-heritability, genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization involving these phenotypes substantially differ when calculated using within-sibship estimates. For example, genetic correlations between educational attainment and height largely disappear. In contrast, analyses of most clinical phenotypes (e.g. LDL-cholesterol) were generally consistent between population and within-sibship models. We also report compelling evidence of polygenic adaptation on taller human height using within-sibship data. Large-scale family datasets provide new opportunities to quantify direct effects of genetic variation on human traits and diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {{The UK Biobank cohort is a population-based cohort of 500,000 participants recruited in the United Kingdom (UK) between 2006 and 2010. Approximately 9.2 million individuals aged 40{\^a}€``69 years who lived within 25 miles (40 km) of one of 22 assessment centers in England, Wales, and Scotland were invited to enter the cohort, and 5.5\\% participated in the baseline assessment. The representativeness of the UK Biobank cohort was investigated by comparing demographic characteristics between nonresponders and responders. Sociodemographic, physical, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics of the cohort were compared with nationally representative data sources. UK Biobank participants were more likely to be older, to be female, and to live in less socioeconomically deprived areas than nonparticipants. Compared with the general population, participants were less likely to be obese, to smoke, and to drink alcohol on a daily basis and had fewer self-reported health conditions. At age 70{\^a}€``74 years, rates of all-cause mortality and total cancer incidence were 46.2\\% and 11.8\\% lower, respectively, in men and 55.5\\% and 18.1\\% lower, respectively, in women than in the general population of the same age. UK Biobank is not representative of the sampling population; there is evidence of a {\^a}€{\oe}healthy volunteer{\^a}€ selection bias. Nonetheless, valid assessment of exposure-disease relationships may be widely generalizable and does not require participants to be representative of the population at large.}},
